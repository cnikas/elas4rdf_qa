The requested operation is initiated by a function call which returns immediately, and is completed by the OS in the background. @en,   In computing, vectored I/O, also known as scatter/gather I/O, is a method of input and output by which a single procedure-call sequentially writes data from multiple buffers to a single data stream or reads data from a data stream to multiple buffers.
